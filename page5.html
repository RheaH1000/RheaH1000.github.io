			    <h2>7 Australian Mythical Creatures</h2>
			    <p>Australian mythology stems mainly from the times of immigration between the 1700s and 1800s and stories derived from the Indignenous Australian traditions, many related to Dreamtime. Dreamtime was a belief system dating back to 65,000 years ago and was used by Australia's ancestral people, the Aboriginal. They believed ancestral or spiritual dieties either formed or physically represented the land, sea, animals and people with such elements in the world considered to be the footprints of these metaphysical beings. Such beliefs faded during the time of European settlements, and the focus shifted more to heroes who were said to be able to face difficulties head on and went against authority as well as focusing on the ideal average Australian worker. Such figures and stories were further romanticised during the Australian gold rushes and deemed the <em>The Diggers</em> by the public. Through all those years, however, Dreamtime stories remained a part of Australian mythology through oral story telling, historical accounts, and practices and beliefs of Dreamtime within Aboriginal communities.

		        <p>Belonging in the Australian Aboriginal mythology, this creature is a legendary spirit specifically located in the jungles of Arnhem Land near the Liverpool River's mouth in the Northen Territory. Garkain possess a human head and big flaps of skin on his arms and legs, sort of like wings that allow him to fly. By day, Garkain enjoys a slumber under a pile of leaves. By night, he attacks any travellers within his domain by flying up, swooping down and then enveloping them in the folds of his wings, which reak a foul stench, to suffocate them and eat their flesh. The victims he eats are then left as wandering spirits of the jungle, searching for their resting place.

		        <p>A nadubi are nocturnal spirits found within the scrubs on the rocky plateau of Arnhem Land and serve as warnings against those who dare travel alone in the night. Overall, they have a humanoid appearance with barbed spines sprouting from their elbows and knees. For female nadubi, the spines can also be found on their vulva. Nadubi often steal meat from the Aboriginal people who place the meat in trees overnight; if meat's been cookec with a fire, a nadubi would even eat the ashes and charcoal where the fat has been spilt. After creeping up on a spotted victim, the spines are used to project or shoot onto the victim's body. However, it's possible to save a victim of a nadubi by removing the spines as fast as possible by a medicine man, people who can only see nadubi and therefore the only ones who can keep them away from encampments. If their aid is administered too late, the victim gets sick and dies, and the aid of a medicine man isn't gauranteed to work.
