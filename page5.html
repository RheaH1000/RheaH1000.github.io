			    <h2>7 Australian Mythical Creatures</h2>
			    <p>Australian mythology stems mainly from the times of immigration between the 1700s and 1800s and stories derived from the Indignenous Australian traditions, many related to Dreamtime. Dreamtime was a belief system dating back to 65,000 years ago and was used by Australia's ancestral people, the Aboriginal. They believed ancestral or spiritual dieties either formed or physically represented the land, sea, animals and people with such elements in the world considered to be the footprints of these metaphysical beings. Such beliefs faded during the time of European settlements, and the focus shifted more to heroes who were said to be able to face difficulties head on and went against authority as well as focusing on the ideal average Australian worker. Such figures and stories were further romanticised during the Australian gold rushes and deemed the <em>The Diggers</em> by the public. Through all those years, however, Dreamtime stories remained a part of Australian mythology through oral story telling, historical accounts, and practices and beliefs of Dreamtime within Aboriginal communities.

		        <p>Belonging in the Australian Aboriginal mythology, this creature is a legendary spirit specifically located in the jungles of Arnhem Land near the Liverpool River's mouth in the Northen Territory. Garkain possess a human head and big flaps of skin on his arms and legs, sort of like wings that allow him to fly. By day, Garkain enjoys a slumber under a pile of leaves. By night, he attacks any travellers within his domain by flying up, swooping down and then enveloping them in the folds of his wings, which reak a foul stench, to suffocate them and eat their flesh. The victims he eats are then left as wandering spirits of the jungle, searching for their resting place.

		        <p>According to Luigi D'Albertis, an Italian naturalist from around the mid 1800s and early 1900s, he claimed to seeing the Kusa Kap, describing it to be a giant eagle with wings, spanning from 16 to 22 feet, and made a noise like a steam engine when used to fly. However, the story of the Kusa Kap told by the natives give greater depth into this great bird that makes it more than just a mysterious specimen of an eagle-looking animal. The story is told on the islands of Dauan and Mabuiag in the Torres Strait, each with their own version which the only difference between them is the name of the fishermen used in the story and that the version of the Dauan is more detailed and will be the one told here. The story starts with a successful and handsome young dugong hunter from Dauan named Kaudab who married a beautiful woman named Bakar. However, Kaudab was also longed for by Giz who was a dogai, a cunning female spirit with long ears and was capable of shapeshifting. With her desire for the young man came with her jealousy for Bakar who had this man instead of her. One day, Bakar went to look for an octopus in a rockpool, which Giz decided to turn into to grab Bakar with her tentacles. With Bakar's husband too far away to hear her cries, Giz pulled Bakar underwater and through an underwater tunnel called the Apangabia-taian to her island of Kusar near New Guinea where she left Bakar. When Giz returned to Kaudab's home, she shifting to appear as Bakar, and tried to cook for Kaudab when he came home. However, with her lack of knowledge to cook, wild cackling and frequent habit of breaking wind crudely, her deception was transparent to Kaudab. Meanwhile, with nothing to eat on the island, Bakar ate some kusa seeds which made her pregnant with an sea-eagle looking egg as a result. The egg hatched into a baby eagle who she cared for dearly and named her child Kusa Kap after the needs. In time, Kusa Kap grew quickly and was strong enough to fly back to Daudai and back, providing her basic cooking tools and dugong back as meat for her to cook. One day, Bakar instructed her son to go find Kaudab's house where he told Kaudab of his wife's current situation by responding to his questions with nods. He then helped Kaudab to Bakar's island, and the couple were finally united. As for Giz, Kuka Kap swooped onto her with his talons and kept dropping and catching her repeatedly in the air, eventually letting her go far from Dauan. She plunged into the sea where she turned into stone. At that she became Dogail Malu, the dogai sea.

		        <p>A nadubi are nocturnal spirits found within the scrubs on the rocky plateau of Arnhem Land and serve as warnings against those who dare travel alone in the night. Overall, they have a humanoid appearance with barbed spines sprouting from their elbows and knees. For female nadubi, the spines can also be found on their vulva. Nadubi often steal meat from the Aboriginal people who place the meat in trees overnight; if meat's been cookec with a fire, a nadubi would even eat the ashes and charcoal where the fat has been spilt. After creeping up on a spotted victim, the spines are used to project or shoot onto the victim's body. However, it's possible to save a victim of a nadubi by removing the spines as fast as possible by a medicine man, people who can only see nadubi and therefore the only ones who can keep them away from encampments. If their aid is administered too late, the victim gets sick and dies, and the aid of a medicine man isn't gauranteed to work.
