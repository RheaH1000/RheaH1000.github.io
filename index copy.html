    	<!-- based on HOMEWORK 5 -->

    	<!-- IDEAS
	      	- countries plan to research myths on (including ones did):
	      		United States (info and design pres)
	      		the Philippines (info and design pres)
	      		Australia
	      		Chiloé Archipelago (Chile)
	      		The Turkic Countries
	      	- refine/rely info on other sites other than wikipedia!
	      	- sources
	      	- the upcoming myths had overall info on them... do so with the other two (use same overview info in final project)
	      	- cite pictures (refer to Week6) >M< (images - right click and Search Google for Images; background images - code background image as an image again, in intro section and treat it as a reg. image)
    	-->

    	<!-- PLAN *******************

    			- STEP 1:
		    		- (D) refine (maybe add to) info from outside wikipedia
		    		- (D) refine overview to be more informative like the future countries
		    		- (D) install external font awesome icons (use for email and instagram) + (css) text space (in FEATURES WANTED, find out)

		    	- STEP 2:
		    		- *provide directions/instructions on how to navigate (ex, select this box to go to so and so)
		    		- install buttons that user will use to navigate from page to page (nav bar: homepage)
		    		- (D) button to scroll back to top
		    		- (D) Home Page (link tag) Explore (button tag; refer to bookmark link, especially the example)
		    		- cite pictures!
		    			- possible method: images - right click and Search Google for Images; background images - code background image as an image again, in intro section and treat it as a reg. image
		    		

		    	- STEP 3:
		    		- place css code into separate pages (external style sheet); refer to NWeek 7 notes
		    		- delete the explore more page (at least separate it from the nav bar)
		    		- DELETE THIS PAGE FROM GITHUB!
    		css
    		- (D) refer to "FEATURES WANTED"
    		- put into external css page; refer to NWeek 7 notes
