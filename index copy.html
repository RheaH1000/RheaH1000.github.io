	      	- refine/rely info on other sites other than wikipedia!
	      	- sources
	      	- the upcoming myths had overall info on them... do so with the other two (use same overview info in final project)
	      	- cite pictures (refer to Week6) >M< (images - right click and Search Google for Images; background images - code background image as an image again, in intro section and treat it as a reg. image)
